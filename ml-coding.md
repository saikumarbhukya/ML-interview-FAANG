# <a name="ml-coding"></a> 2. ML/Data Coding :robot:
ML coding module may or may not exist in particular companies interviews. The good news is that, there are a limited number of ML algorithms that candidates are expected to be able to code. The most common ones include:
- k-means clustering
- k-nearest neighbors
- Decision trees
- Perceptron, MLP
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Sampling
  - stratified sampling
  - uniform sampling
  - reservoir sampling
  - sampling multinomial distribution
  - random generator
- NLP algorithms (if that's your area of work)
  - bigrams
  - tf-idf

## Sample codes
- You can find some sample codes (or links to ones) in the [ML_Coding_Problems Notebook](https://github.com/alirezadir/machine-learning-interview-enlightener/blob/main/Notebooks/ML_Coding_Problems.ipynb).
